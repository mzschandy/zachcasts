## Episode Description

Dungeon Master Zach Schandorf-Lartey introduces the players, the characters, and the Avatar: The Last Airbender like setting for this new Dungeons and Dragons campaign. 

The Avatar and his companions receive a mysterious letter from a stranger requesting help, so they travel to Yakoya City to meet and perhaps lend a helping hand, and perhaps run into some trouble as well.

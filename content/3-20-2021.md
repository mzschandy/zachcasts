## Episode Description

Dungeon Master Zach Schandorf-Lartey forgot to record a bunch of sessions, so this episode skips far off into the feature. DM Zach exlains what happened between the episodes but the recap is pretty long, so skip to 9:32 to skip all of that.

Team Avatar (minus Syndee who awas absent for this session) returns to Naolin Village and delivers the oods they rescued from the Redbrand hideout to Quin and Bao.Later, they organize the Naolin Village deputies against a massive bandit raid, and come face to face with mysterious foes.
